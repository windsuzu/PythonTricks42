# PythonTricks42

42 for the universe, which means I want to use the opportunity of creating this repository to learn all the skills of python!

All the tricks in the repo are built on the idea that you have a deep understanding of the basic operations of Python, such as string, condition, loop, list, dict, tuple, and so on. 

All tricks are based on the python 3 implementation.
